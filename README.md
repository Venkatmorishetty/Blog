# 🚀 Exploring Generative AI  
### Concepts, Tools & Real-World Applications

## 📘 Overview
This repository documents my ongoing exploration of **Generative AI (GenAI)** — focusing on **core concepts, practical tools, and real-world applications**.

The goal is not just to learn how AI works in theory, but to understand **how it is applied in practice** to solve real problems, support decision-making, and improve everyday workflows.

Each entry in this repository represents a focused exploration of **one concept, one tool, or one application** at a time.
