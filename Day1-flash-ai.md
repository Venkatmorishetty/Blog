- 🔗 Integrate directly with product pages  

The emphasis is on **clarity, speed, and minimal user effort**.

> **From generating content → to supporting better human decisions**

Key characteristics:
- AI assists rather than replaces judgment  
- Value comes from reduced cognitive load  
- The application fits naturally into an existing workflow  

This represents a mature and practical direction for GenAI adoption.
